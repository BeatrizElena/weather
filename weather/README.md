# Local Weather App

Small app that loads local city and country, the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit and a short description of weather conditions. API courtesy of openweathermap.org.

In order for your app to run, you need to obtain your own API key from openweathermap.org as this code hides my personal key. In the URL, replace my variable `key` for your own key.
